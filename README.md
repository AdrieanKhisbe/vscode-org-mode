## Conventions

### Naming

The full name of this project is `VS Code Org Mode`. It is abbreviated `vscode-org-mode`. In the VS Code Marketplace, it is listed as `Org Mode`.

Actions are prefixed with `org-`.

Filenames use kebab case.

When referring to the original Org mode, we capitalize the "O" and leave the "m" lower case. This is in keeping with the original teams usage on [orgmode.org](http://orgmode.org/).

### Code

Use TSLint with default settings.

### Git

- `master` is used for production deploys.
- `develop` is the main branch into which new features are merged. It is protected from direct pushes, so all changes come from pull requests.
- Features: For all new additions, create a new feature branch. When complete, create a pull request into `develop` for that branch. Optionally, prefix feature branch names with `feature/`.

## Gratitude

The original Org mode was written for Emacs by Carsten Dominik, with the help and support of [an impressive list of geniuses](http://orgmode.org/org.html#History-and-Acknowledgments). Our work is inspired by though not associated with their original masterpiece.
